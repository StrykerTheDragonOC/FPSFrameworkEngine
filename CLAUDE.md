- **NOTES**
1. This game takes mechanics from Phantom Forces, Battlefield 2042, Randomizer/ Item Asylum 
2. References Do not have to match 1:1 Visually but all the stats and info should be there along with the classes.
3. This game is meant to be realistic but with arcade style movement & Fast-Paced action. The Guns should be balanced but do a realistic amount of damage.
4. You can go ahead and premake different guns in the menu but just have them temporarily disabled for now
5.  I'd also like a special ntw variant that can be given via that has a suppressor on it, that while fling the player back slightly upon firing and upon hitting & killing the enemy will send both you & the enemy into orbit killing both players


- **UNIVERSAL RULES**
1. Scripts should define the correct references & should be updated if a script name or location is changes.
2. Script shouldn't be overly complicated IE: GrenadeSystem vs AdvancedGrenadeSystem. The first ones more streamline.
3. Emojis shouldn't be used in any UI as it doesn't look professional instead you should create images with no I'd and leave them as the icon so that they can be created once the system functions.
4. Use the references folder for instances like the LoadoutUI, Menu, & In-Game HUD.
7. There are UI's that should connect between each other such as the menu connecting to the Loadout, Settings, Leaderboard, & Skin shop. 
8. The player stats, match timer, player count, current gamemode & voting system for gamemodes should connect and update within the menu & function properly.

- **CORE GAMEPLAY & MECHANICS**
Upon joining the game the player Spawns inside the menu & also is placed on the lobby team. The lobby team will have its own spawn that's away from the map & when the player hits space in the main menu/ on the main section or hits deploy it switches to either the KFC or FBI team. The player will spawn on a random spawn of that team. When the player is deployed jn they will spawn with random  weapons they have unlocked or prebought. The player can (sprint, crouch, prone, dive, & combat roll.). The player dives by jumping & hitting X while midair.
The default weapons that the player has unlocked by default will have 2 from each category excluding SniperRifles until they are unlocked, & Secondaries Subcategory other. Grenades & Melees will only use The Default Rank 0 PocketKnife & M26 Grenade until the player unlocks (& or) Pre-buys a weapon. Upon first joining the game at Rank 0 the randomized weapon pool will grab a random Primary, Secondary, Melee, Grenade & Special
Different  Onscreen effects like bleeding, Blur (dizzyness), Flashbang, ETC will appear over the players screen when in combat. These Effects will use custom image ids that will appear over the screen. The Flashbang can just be a white Frame that slowly fades to transparent & connects with the EffectsSystem to play the ringing noise. blood particles when shot from the players body that can be seen on the server and small bloodpools (Currently Sound & Image ID's have been setup properly by me so don't change them for now.) There will be Enviroment Destruction that is slightly realistic but can perform well on low end PC's. There are also Vehicles like tanks & helicopters with destruction physics, & AA Guns that can be placed/mounted ontop of buildings that do higher damage to vehicles, some guns that have armor piercing as a conversion can do damage to heavy armored vehicles. most revolver can damage vehicles without any ammo conversion, In the gun config there is a toggle for being able to damage certain vehicles. the ammo conversion toggles that to true but also increase the penetration stat.
There should also be a roblox config in workspace to store different values. The currently planned pickups are: Armor Pickups, Night Vision Goggles, Medical Equipment, Ammo Refill Packs. The Night Visions are used along a actively going Day/Night Cycle that should be pretty slow but wil be night in at ~10 Minutes or more. There should be a radar on the top left of the screen that also has the current score & gamemode name under it. The radar will go off if somone shoots a weapon that isnt suppressed or throws a grenade that explodes. it will show a sort of wave expand and show the players arrow or icon for a few seconds before disappearing. Enemy Player's Footsteps will play when the playerwalks.  the audio should work be 3D orientated. Bullets that fly past you should make a whizz SFX, along with when they hit through walls. Bullets that hit different surfaces/materials will make difference sounds based on them. Each material also has its penetration factor for instance: wood being very poor whilst metal being more strong and requires a higher pentrating gun to pass through. Players can spot enemies in their viewrange by hitting Q which will put a small red indicator over the enemy players body that can be seen by the spotters whole team. Spotting a player will play a sound effect each time you spot a player. the player can crouch somewhere thats not visible from the enemys sightline or hide in a building out of sightline to remove the indicator. you can also place markers with Q to ping a specific area on the map. The game will have custom destruction physics where u can use different perks/abilities like a RPG to explode buildings & watch them crumble. Playerlist should be hidden entirely and when hitting tab a custom player list showing each players rank, Current Match: Kills,Deaths, KDR, Streak, Score. along with what team they are on

- **WEAPONS**
Weapons are put into categories which also have subcategories. Special is the only one to not have a subcategory.
Here are the following categories along with their followed subcategories:
Primary: AssaultRifles, BattleRifles, Carbines, Shotguns, DMRS, LMGS, PDW/SMGS, SniperRifles
Secondary: Pistols, AutoPistols, Revolvers, Other
Melee: OneHandBlade, TwoHandBlade, OneHandBlunt, TwoHandBlunt.
Grenade: Frag, HighExplosive, Other
Special: N/A

**GUNS**
The gun system uses tools that when equip will show the guns viewmodel & plays the equip animation, when the player unequips the tool it plays the dequip animation. Each gun has their own config inside the tool so they can be changed easily, the config should include most of the stats shown in references. The Important ones being: GunName, Type: [Auto,Semi,Burst,HyperBurst], FireRate, Pentration, Damage,Range, BulletDropOff, Recoil, ETC. The Gun's can be inspected with *H* which will play an animation if theres no animation itll just print a warning but not break the system. The guns will have the usual keybinds, *M1* to fire, *R* to reload, T to switch sights (If player has a specific type of scope equipped), V to change firerate.
Guns should be tool based & use a viewmodel when equipping the tool. They each have their own dedicated viewmodel folder & weapon model folder (for stuff like gun preview in menu) Guns should be realistic with advanced stats like: bullet drop, penetration, recoil etc, while also stats that are modified by attachments like suppresion, recoil, & different stats based on ammo types & conversions. Each weapon config will be stored in the tool for that specific weapon. Viewmodels are stored in ReplicatedStorage.FPSSystem.Viewmodels: Then Depending on what Main category & the sub category it will use that for instance The G36 is stored in ReplicatedStorage.FPSSystem.Viewmodels.Primary.AssaultRifles.G36 & then the model will be stored in the G36 folder. When a weapon tool from this system is equipped it will lock the player in first person on dequipping it allow the player to zoom out again. There will be other tools not using this system that require certain keybinds so there might need to be a way to check if a player has a tool from this system or not. So Theoritcally you could make it so that when a player has nothing equipped or a gun from this system you can use the movement system & when a player has a tool it will possibly check if theres any scripts that use keybinds and either disable certain keys from the movement system or somehow have both function properly without one overlapping the other. Usual Ability Keybinds in other systems: Q,E,R,T,Y,G,H,Z,X,C,V,(*B). 
Viewmodels in firstperson should be client sides while on the serverside or what other enemy players see would be different instead they would be animated with a R6 rig which plays the animations using the players avatar that has the gun model attached to the right arm. it will play the animations exported from the rig that will sync with the guns state/ client side action like when firing the gun will recoil on the serverside and show bullet tracers. In the map there will be different pickups that can be placed anywhere on the map manually and could either have a script placed inside or a type of config.Each gun will have attachments & some will be exclusive to that gun Supressors are mostly universal for Primary & secondary weapons, while some guns like the NTW-20 for example cannot have it equipped All Primary guns should have the same grips minus a few that only show up for certain guns. Shotguns can have different ammo types that can increase or decrease the pellet count, for instance birdshot would have around 18, while slugs would only have one. some shotguns like the double barrel or the sawed off can switch their firemode with V to burst mode which fires both shells at once. the gun stats in the gun config should be easily changeable. there are four classes: Assault, Scout, Support, Recon. each class has their own special guns except some share between two classes for instance Recon: Exclusively Has SniperRifles, But also shares Carbines, BattleRifles & DMRS Which Carbine is available in all classes. PDW's Exclusive is Well: PDW Support's Exclusive is LMG Assault is ofc AssaultRifles Assault, Support & Recon Share BattleRifles Assault PDW & Support Share Shotguns Scout & Recon Share DMR Secondaries dont apply to classes so any secondary can be equipped same goes for Melees & Grenades. Attachments will attach to a roblox attachment placed within the weapons model for both the gun preview in the menu & the viewmodels gunmodel. Scopes Should work like they do in phantom forces (the updated scopes though), where u can Hit T on scopes to switch modes between a 3D scope & a UI based scope. if the player is using the UI scope mode, the gun/View should sway a bit and the player should hold shift to stabilize it for a short time before "running out of breath" Laser attachments will start at the guns attachment point. Lasers should be clientsides & or should only be able to be seen by the players own team, but flashlights will show up for everyone. Grip attachments can increase & decrease recoil.(grips can have both positive & negative stat changes) For Instance one grip can increase the guns aimspeed but decreases accuracy. Certain Suppressors will only show on the radar up to a certain stud range. Ammo types for each gun can increase & decrease stats Such as: Armor Piercing (Better penetration lesser damage to torso & head) Some guns have different barrels that can increase range or increase CQC damage in exchange for shorter range. for instance the NTW-20 would have a heavy barrel that makes you much slower but has more range & the obrez barrel which allows you to scope without crouching or leaning against a building/wall but has poor accuracy & requires you to aim up higher to hit the target. or a AssaultRifle can have a carbine barrel (& or) AssaultBarrel while some DMR's & other guns can have a marksman barrel. Shotguns can have different choke barrel attachments that can decrease spread along with other effects. all attachments require a certain amount of kills to unlock for free starting from 5 (if said gun doesent come with free attachments) to 2-3K and so forth. different sights will include iron sights, red dots, & scopes for now.

**GRENADES**
There should be a grenade system in place. there are impact grenades that detonate upon contact with any part or surface, Sticky grenades that will stick to walls, High Explosive grenades, Frag grenades, Smoke Grenades, Flashbangs, Flares (blinds players), & C4 that can be placed and remotely detonated (despawns after awhile & death of the player that placed it) each grenade will have its own explosion radius that decreases the further you are away & some will decrease your walkspeed Some grenades can be cooked while others can't, grenades the can be cooked while tick by expanding the crosshair outward to indicate that a tick has passed and after the final tick the grenade will explode killing the player Each grenade will have its own viewmodel & custom animations as well. Grenades will have custom explosion effects accompanied by the default roblox explosion effect.
Grenades can be hotswapped quickly by hitting *G*


**MELEES**
Melees are set into different groups that being one & two handed blunt & blades. One handed blades instant kill upon backstabbing a player, while blunt ones do more base damage, have more range & can be used to kill multiple players easier One handed weapons are quicker than two handed ones, two handed melees have more range than one handed melees You can right click to play a special attack animation. Melees can be hotswapped quickly by hitting *F* to use the melee and then switch back to your previous tool, holding if will fully switch to the melee tool after it attacks. one handed melees will increase your walkspeed depending on which on you have equipped & two handed blades make you slightly slower.

**SPECIAL**




- **PROGRESSION SYSTEM**
**Note: the Credit name is KFCoins while the credits them selves can be named credits in scripts for easier understanding.
In-Game stats that save being: total kills & deaths for each players profile, Kill to death RATIO per match & on the menu a total KDR/ Kill to death Ratio, total XP gained, XP til level up, next weapon unlock. 
**XP/CURRENCY**
There will be a credit/currency system that allows you to buy new weapons attachments & skins, Guns that require a specific level can be prebought at a slightly inflated price, attachments can also be prebought for guns owned their price stays the same Each Rank-Up you gain [X] Amount of credits that increase each time you level up along with required amount of XP to level up. XP can be gained by: Getting Kills, Assists, Objectives/Captures & Holding Objectives (Small Amount), Wallbangs (Small Amount), Suppressing an enemy (Small Amount), headshots, long distance shots, quickscopes, no scopes, backstabs, Double/Triple/Quad Kills, Spotted Player Kills & Assists, Gaining mastery to each weapon & unlocking attachments. When you rank up you should get a popup on your screen that shows: Level Up! Rank (X) +(X)Credits. The Currency is KFCoins

When you rank up you should get a popup on your screen that shows: Level Up! Rank (X) +(X)Credits. Not Sure what to call the currency so for now make it credits but make it so that it can be changed whenever. XP to level up should work as followed using this formula: XP = 1000 × ((rank² + rank) ÷ 2). The Formula that calculates rank reward from rank 1 to 20 is: Credit = ((rank-1)* 5)+ 200 while rewards past Level 20 should use: Credit = (Rank * 5)+ 200 \
**LEADERBOARD**

- **SHOP/LOADOUT**
*Note*: The Shop is only for skins, while the loadout menu allows you to change weapons but also prebuy weapons, Equip attachents, & Edit The Skins.

**LOADOUT**
The gun customization menu should display advanced stats, allow previewing the gun model stored in ReplicatedStorage.FPSSystem.WeaponModels.(Primary,Secondary,Grenade,Melee).(Then the subcategory) 

**PERKS**
There will be Unlockable perks such as double jump & a temporary speed boost to start & some will have a cooldown while perks like double jump have no cooldown. There are also
Ammo. Special rounds can be equipped by a perk giving temporary status effects to the enemies who are shot, The Special rounds are time based and will run out within ~30 or less or if the player has to reload (excluding snipers or guns that dont have multiple shots at once) They Will also have a cooldown of ~30 or less Current Status Effects: Incendiary, (Fire VFX over enemies body & does D.O.T (Damage over time) or fire damage.) Frostbite, (Slows the player down & if shot enough times freezes them in a block of ice.) Explosive (Explodes where the bullets hit) There are also other status effects that the player can have such as: Bleeding (D.O.T, Bleed Damage) Fracture (Slower Walkspeed,small blood trail) Deafened (a grenade was exploded nearby & a ringing sound will play for a few seconds, but is quiet to not annoy players) Etc. Some status effects can be removed by a medical item like a bandage which stops bleeding & tourniquet which stops fractures the status effects will remove after a decent time has passed (meant to be long but not excruciatingly long)

**SKIN SHOP**
Weaponskins can be bought in the menu under the shop section, they will be applied on each weapon (as a placeholder for now make it grab a texture ID from a folder or something) The Skins change every 24 hours in the shop while some can be made exclusive & limited

Team Deathmatch (TDM), King of the Hill (KOTH), Kill Confirmed (KC), Capture the Flag (CTF), Flare Domination, Hardpoint (HD), Gun Game (GG), Duel (secondary weapons only), Knife Fight (melee only), with modes being votable or changeable via admin commands. Some of the modes will have abbrievations mentioned above while stuff like Flare Domination, Duel & Knife fight won't. Objectives should be placed manually and have their spawn/position stored in a part on the map that can be in serverstorage.

- **SETTINGS**
There should be a setting section in the menu that has a sensitivity slider (seperate from the roblox client/application sensitivity), a ragdoll factor slider that can be increased to send players bodies flying upon killing them with a weapon from this system FOV, (Only affects the players FOV when a weapon from this system is equipped.) more settings will be added in the future.
