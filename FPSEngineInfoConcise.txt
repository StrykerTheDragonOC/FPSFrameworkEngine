This game is based on Phantom Forces with Battlefield aspects. Some of it is unique.
The gameplay style should remain realistic while still being arcade-like & fast-paced.

Movement will include:
- Ledge grabbing
- Sliding
- Dolphin diving (performed by pressing X midair)
- Crouching & prone states

Teams:
There are two teams: KFC & FBI.
- FBI spawn around the bunker based on the spawn locations in the Spawns Folder
- KFC spawn in & around the city near the KFC

Buildings have already been created, so the game only needs to grab spawn locations for each team & spawn players randomly.

The game will feature Phantom Forces-style gameplay combined with Battlefield aspects such as:
- Environment destruction
- Vehicles (tanks & helicopters with destruction physics)

Each gamemode resets/changes every ~20 minutes before sending players back to the menu & waiting for the gamemode to set up.

Core systems:
- XP & leveling system
- Gun customization menu (attachments for guns & weapons are chosen from random spawns)
- Randomized weapon spawns from categories: Primary, Secondary, Melee, Extra/Abilities

In-game stats that save:
- Total kills & deaths (per player profile)
- Kill-to-death ratio (per match & total KDR in menu)
- Total XP gained
- XP until level up
- Next weapon unlock

Credits / currency system:
- Buy new weapons, attachments, & skins
- Guns requiring a specific level can be pre-bought at a higher price
- Attachments can also be pre-bought if the gun is already owned

- XP gained from kills, assists, objectives, captures, holding objectives, wallbangs, suppressing enemies, headshots, long-distance shots, quickscopes, no-scopes, backstabs, multikills, spotting kills/assists, weapon mastery, & unlocking attachments

Level-up system:
- Popup shows "Level Up! Rank (X) + (X) Credits"
- Currency called "Credits" (can be changed later)

Formulas:
XP = 1000 × ((rank² + rank) ÷ 2)
Credits (Rank 1–20) = ((rank - 1) * 5) + 200

Misc Rules:
1. Proper referencing required

3. No emojis — use placeholders or icons instead
4. Rewrite existing scripts instead of duplicating
5. Check provided reference images/GIFs for context
