# Scope System Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Scope System has been fully integrated into your FPS game, providing both 3D and UI-based scope rendering for sniper rifles and other scoped weapons.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **ScopeSystem Module** (`src/ReplicatedStorage/FPSSystem/Modules/ScopeSystem.lua`)
- ✅ UI-based scope rendering with circular lens
- ✅ 3D scope rendering (Phantom Forces style)
- ✅ Toggle between modes with **T** key
- ✅ Weapon sway system
- ✅ Breath holding with **Shift** key
- ✅ Multiple scope configurations (Red Dot, Holographic, ACOG, 4x, 8x, Sniper)
- ✅ Smooth FOV transitions
- ✅ Reticle customization per scope type

### 2. **Integration with ViewmodelSystem**
- ✅ Automatic weapon detection
- ✅ Scope activation on aiming
- ✅ Viewmodel visibility handling when scoped
- ✅ Seamless transitions

### 3. **Client System Initialization**
- ✅ ScopeSystem added to `ClientSystemsInitializer`
- ✅ Automatic initialization on game start
- ✅ Available via `_G.ClientSystems.Scope`

### 4. **RemoteEventsManager Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed RemoteEventsManager dependencies from 8+ files
- ✅ Direct RemoteEvent references now used
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code

## How to Use

### For Weapon Scripts

Your weapon scripts should call `ViewmodelSystem:SetAiming(true/false)` when the player aims. The ScopeSystem will automatically handle the rest.

**Example:**
```lua
-- When player right-clicks to aim
function startAiming()
    isAiming = true
    ViewmodelSystem:SetAiming(true)  -- ScopeSystem automatically activates
end

function stopAiming()
    isAiming = false
    ViewmodelSystem:SetAiming(false)  -- ScopeSystem automatically deactivates
end
```

See `ExampleSniperWeapon.client.lua` for a complete implementation.

### Controls (When Scoped)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Right-Click** | Aim/Enter scope |
| **T** | Toggle between 3D and UI scope modes |
| **Shift** | Hold breath to stabilize (reduces sway) |
| **Left-Click** | Fire weapon |
| **R** | Reload |

### Configuring Scopes in WeaponConfig

Add scope attachment to your weapon config:

```lua
["YourSniperName"] = {
    Name = "YourSniper",
    Category = "Primary",
    Type = "SniperRifles",

    -- Other stats...

    Attachments = {
        Optic = "Sniper Scope",  -- Options: "Red Dot", "Holographic", "ACOG", "4x Scope", "8x Scope", "Sniper Scope"
        -- Other attachments...
    }
}
```

### Available Scope Types

1. **Red Dot** - 1.5x zoom, UI mode, reflex sight
2. **Holographic** - 1.5x zoom, UI mode, holographic reticle
3. **ACOG** - 4.0x zoom, supports both 3D and UI modes
4. **4x Scope** - 4.0x zoom, magnified optic
5. **8x Scope** - 8.0x zoom, long-range scope
6. **Sniper Scope** - 10.0x zoom, maximum magnification

### Customizing Scope Configurations

Edit `ScopeSystem.lua` to add or modify scope configs:

```lua
local scopeConfigs = {
    ["Your Scope Name"] = {
        ZoomLevel = 6.0,           -- Magnification level
        ScopeType = "Magnified",   -- "RefleX" or "Magnified"
        FOV = 15,                  -- Field of view when scoped
        UI = false,                -- Start in UI mode or 3D mode
        Reticle = "rbxassetid://YOURID",  -- Reticle image
        ReticleSize = UDim2.new(0, 2, 0, 2)  -- Reticle size
    }
}
```

## Weapon Sway System

The scope system includes realistic weapon sway:

### Sway Factors
- **Movement Speed**: Faster movement = more sway
- **Mouse Movement**: Camera movement causes sway
- **Zoom Level**: Higher zoom = more noticeable sway
- **Breath Holding**: Hold Shift to reduce sway by 80%

### Breath Holding Mechanics
- Hold **Shift** to stabilize aim
- Reduces sway multiplier from 1.0 to 0.2
- No duration limit (can hold indefinitely)
- Release to return to normal sway

## Testing Your Implementation

### Console Commands

```lua
-- Test scope modes
_G.ScopeCommands.setMode("UI")      -- Switch to UI mode
_G.ScopeCommands.setMode("3D")      -- Switch to 3D mode

-- Test different scopes
_G.ScopeCommands.testScope("Sniper Scope")
_G.ScopeCommands.testScope("ACOG")

-- Toggle scope on/off
_G.ScopeCommands.toggleScope()
```

### Debug Information

The ScopeSystem prints helpful debug info:
- Scope entry/exit messages
- Current zoom level
- Scope mode changes
- Weapon sway values

## Next Steps

### To Add Scoping to Your Sniper Rifles:

1. **Create or update your sniper weapon tool:**
   - Use `ExampleSniperWeapon.client.lua` as a template
   - Place the LocalScript inside your weapon tool

2. **Configure the weapon in WeaponConfig:**
   ```lua
   ["MySniperRifle"] = {
       Name = "My Sniper Rifle",
       Category = "Primary",
       Type = "SniperRifles",
       FireRate = 40,
       Damage = 100,
       Range = 5000,
       MaxAmmo = 5,
       MaxReserveAmmo = 30,
       ReloadTime = 3.5,
       Attachments = {
           Optic = "Sniper Scope"  -- This enables scoping!
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Create the viewmodel:**
   - Place in `ReplicatedStorage.FPSSystem.Viewmodels.Primary.SniperRifles.MySniperRifle`
   - Ensure it has a `CameraPart` for proper positioning

4. **Test in-game:**
   - Equip the weapon
   - Right-click to scope
   - Press T to toggle scope modes
   - Hold Shift to stabilize

## Troubleshooting

### Scope UI not showing?
- Check that ScopeSystem is initialized in ClientSystemsInitializer
- Verify the weapon has a scope attachment configured
- Check console for error messages

### Weapon sway too strong?
- Adjust sway parameters in ScopeSystem.lua (lines 61-66)
- Modify breath multiplier for more/less stabilization

### FOV not changing?
- Ensure weapon config has proper scope attachment
- Check that ViewmodelSystem is calling ScopeSystem:SetAiming()
- Verify no other scripts are modifying Camera.FieldOfView

### Viewmodel still visible when scoped?
- Check that SetViewmodelVisibility() is being called
- Ensure weapon parts have proper transparency properties

## Advanced Features

### Custom Scope Reticles
Replace the reticle image IDs in scopeConfigs with your custom images.

### Scope Glint Effect
Add a bright particle to the scope lens that enemies can see (not yet implemented).

### Variable Zoom
Modify the zoom level dynamically based on mouse scroll wheel (not yet implemented).

### Scope Blackout
Implement darkening around the scope edges for more realistic effect (partially implemented).

## Files Modified

1. `src/ReplicatedStorage/FPSSystem/Modules/ScopeSystem.lua` - Main scope system (reviewed)
2. `src/ReplicatedStorage/FPSSystem/Modules/ViewmodelSystem.lua` - Added scope integration
3. `src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/ClientSystemsInitializer.client.lua` - Added ScopeSystem initialization
4. `ExampleSniperWeapon.client.lua` - Example implementation (created)
5. Multiple files - Removed RemoteEventsManager dependencies

## Performance Notes

- Scope UI elements are only created once and reused
- Weapon sway calculations run at ~60 FPS
- 3D scope mode is more performant than UI mode
- FOV transitions use TweenService for smooth animation
